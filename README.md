*SPU* is believed to be the abbreviation of *SPU Performs Updating*. It's a npm package that provides method to update Minecraft commands.

## How to Use

0. Installation.
    ```Bash
    npm i spu
    ```
1. Import.
    ```TypeScript
    import { update } from 'spu'
    ```
2. Update.
    ```TypeScript
    update(commands: string[], from: number, to: number) => { commands: string[], logs: string[], state: 'success' | 'warning' | 'error'}
    ```
    e.g.
    ```TypeScript
    update(['/kill'], 12, 13) // { commands: ['/kill @s'], ... }
    update(['setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:sign 0 replace'], 12, 14) // { commands: ['setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:oak_sign replace'], ... }
    ```

## File Structure

- `src`: Source code written in TypeScript.
- `lib`: Output JavaScript files.

## How it Works

The *WheelChief* system will try to parse your command(s) when you called 'update()'. All commands is stored in a `CmdNode`, whose format is very similiar to the format of the `commands.json` file that data generator provides:

```TypeScript
interface CmdNode {
    type: 'root' | 'literal' | 'argument'
    children?: { [nodeName: string]: CmdNode }
    parser?: string
    properties?: { [propertyName: string]: any }
    updater?: string
    executable?: boolean
    redirect?: string[]
    spu_script?: string
}
```

e.g. The input is `foobar @a {baz:qux}` and it can be parsed in the following nodes:

```TypeScript
{
    type: 'root',
    children: {
        foobar: {
            type: 'literal',
            children: {
                entity: {
                    type: 'argument',
                    parser: 'minecraft:entity',
                    properties: {
                        amount: 'multiple',
                        type: 'entities'
                    },
                    children: {
                        nbt: {
                            type: 'argument',
                            parser: 'minecraft:nbt',
                            updater: 'spgoding:entity_nbt',
                            executable: true,
                            spu_script: '%0 $setNbtToSelector%1%2'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And then the WheelChief will return this (if no `updater` is specific in the `CmdNode`, the WheelChief will store its `parser` in `updater`):

```TypeScript
{
    command: {
        args: [
            { value: 'foobar', updater: undefined }, 
            { value: '@a', updater: 'minecraft:entity' }, 
            { value: '{baz:qux}', updater: 'spgoding:entity_nbt' }
        ],
        spu_script: '%0 $setNbtToSelector%1%2'
    },
    ...
}
```

The WheelChief will update every argument according to its `updater`. All updaters are defined in `src/utils/wheel_chief/updater.ts` and `src/**to**/updater.ts`. After updating all arguments we will get this (well, it just adds some quotes in this example):


```TypeScript
{
    command: {
        args: [
            { value: 'foobar', updater: undefined }, 
            { value: '@a', updater: 'minecraft:entity' }, 
            { value: '{baz:"qux"}', updater: 'spgoding:entity_nbt' }
        ],
        spu_script: '%0 $setNbtToSelector%1%2'
    },
    ...
}
```

Finally the `spu_script` will be executed. `%0` will be replaced with the first argument of the command(`args[0].value`), `%1` will be the second(`args[1].value`), and so on. A token that begins with `$` will be executed as a function with following `%n` as its parameter(s). So finally you will get `foobar @a[nbt={baz:"qux"}]`.
